# Streamlining SSH configuration

## Show your .ssh/config file, and how you edited it (with VScode, another program, etc)

I edited it in the default wsl vim installation.

## Show the ssh command logging you into your account using just the alias you chose.

## Show an scp command copying a file to your account using just the alias you chose.

This is the `scp -r` demonstration. It shows a working usage of `scp`, however, so I chose to use it here.

# Setup Github Access from ieng6

## Show where the public key you made is stored on Github and in your user account (screenshot).

## Show where the private key you made is stored on your user account (but not its contents) as a screenshot.

## Show running git commands to commit and push a change to Github while logged into your ieng6 account.

## Show a link for the resulting commit.


# Copy whole directories using `scp -r`

## Show copying your whole markdown-parse directory to your ieng6 account.

## Show logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling and running the tests for your repository.

## Show (like in the last step of the first lab) combining scp, ;, and ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line.

This is the `scp -r` demonstration from the lab. I have used this before but it applies here perfectly.
